# pcalc

A text-based calculator that lives on the gnome panel (top bar), out of the way
of your work.

In it's default configuration, the calculator provides a text entry field on the
panel into which a mathematical expression can be entered for evaluation; the
calculator also provides an icon next to the entry field that can be pressed
(clicked) to present a popup that has a larger entry field and help information.

The calculator can be configured to disable the entry field on the panel so that
only the icon appears there; pressing (clicking) the icon presents the popup
having the larger entry field.

The calculator can also be configured to not show help information on the popup,
in which case the popup will have the larger entry field by itself.
## Basic guide for expressions
An example of an expression is 2+4*8, which means multiply 4 by 8 and add 2 to
the result.

Supported operators:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ addition\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- subtraction and negation\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* multiplication\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ division\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^ or ** exponentiation (right-associative)

Use parentheses to override operator precedence; e.g.,
(2+4)*8 means add 2 to 4 and multiply the result by 8.

The following special values and functions are available:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pi : Did you know that March 14 is Pi day?\

## Manual installation notes
- Place the project folder in **~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions**
- Rename the folder to **pcalc<span>@</span>mgeck64.github.com** so the gnome shell will find it
- **cd** to the folder and run **make** (or **make all**) from there
- Reset the gnome shell (if under X11 then press **Alt-F2** and then submit the
    **r** command; else if under Wayland then log out and log back in)
